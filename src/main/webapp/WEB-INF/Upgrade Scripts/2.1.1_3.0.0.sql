First, 2.5.0 is the latest version of commercial 1W remote and 3.0 is for NYC 1W remote.\r\n2.       Second, as you aware, there is optical link budget difference between commercial remote and NYC remote, so there are different firmware version applied to NYC.\r\nA.       NYC system supports 10 dBo optic link between ODU and remote.\r\nB.        Commercial version supports only 5dBo optic link between ODU and remote.\r\nC.        In this reason, if there is 2.5 firmware loaded to NYC remote, optical link saturation will happen due to link budget mismatch.\r\nD.       Except the firmware version difference on remote, firmware version on other units (ODU, BIU, MDBU, RDU) are the same between commercial version and NYC gear.\r\n \r\nI am still in the office even though today is holiday in Korea.\r\nIf you have further clarification, please let me know now.\r\nThank you.',1381326361475,253,NULL),

	(421,'555 support has been receiving reports of poor call quality with Verizon for the last couple months. I was dispatched to investigate, and immediately noticed a high amount of uplink power coming through the DAS on the Verizon 850 band. I ruled out PIM but I found that there was a persistent signal at 840 mHz which falls neatly within the uplink band. While I determined that this was most likely not in the Verizon uplink channel, it is most likely the explanation for the constant power coming along the uplink path in the DAS. While I would not completely rule out this being an outside interference issue, this is well outside the Verizon uplink channel which should be at around 829-831 given the downlink channels they have coming in. I pulled the lower bands\' downlink signals to rule out PIM and the uplink power remained and the noise floor did not drop at all, so PIM was not an issue. I also checked the signal to noise ratio between the optical link between the DAS and the BDA, which is a common place for signal to noise ratio issues to arise. Again, this turned out to not be an issue, the signal was attenuated properly on the uplink path just before the BDA and the SNR was at an acceptable spot. After my testing, I determined that the DAS was functioning properly with appropriate uplink and downlink gain without raising the noise floor more than is normal. I would recommend Verizon investigate their BDA and also look into the possible interference on their uplink path. This ticket will remain open until further updates. ',1391893713147,158,NULL),

As we discussed over the phone yesterday the customer is experiencing degraded performance and disconnections on their Wifi network when users are in close proximity to the DAS antennas (rolling patient information carts). It appears that the peak/center of the noise is around 2.488ghz but when a wifi device is within a 10-15? area near the antennas it seems to overwhelm the device and create the appearance of broad spectrum noise across the 2.4 bands. The situation is occurring across all 11 ROU?s in the hospital covering the lower and 1st levels.\r\n    During the troubleshooting we have found that the ?noise? is most evident in 2 scenarios.  The first and most prominent is directly out of the ROU itself and found that if I disconnected either 850cell input or the 700LTE input from the combiner card the noise would dissipate. The second scenario was that if the SISO input was disconnected from the combiner card to leave only 850 to pass and left the MIMO leg of 700 attached the noise was then visible at the DAS antenna locations (but not at the ROU?s).   I?ve attached a couple of photos that will hopefully help describe the situation. Also I have included Jesse from Goodmans service dept on this email, he will be working with you and the customer.\r\n \r\n \r\nDAS-AT&T\r\n700 LTE- 734-744\r\n850 UMTS- 869-879\r\nNoise peak- 2488 (2472-2502)\r\n \r\nWifi test software used by customer- Channelyzer and Air Magnet\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThanks, Duane Frey\r\n817.714.7025\r\n\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nAl is testing this in his lab this morning in TX to see if he can recreate this scenario.',1392222508873,152,NULL),

It is there as a function of eliminating the DAS noise power prior to the BDA(remember this statement when you take the class, very important-Friis Formula regarding cascaded amplifiers). \r\nWhich leads me to believe there is something going on between our BIU port and the top of the rack at the cell site, as we already verified the signal level and SNR was better than spec out of the Solid equipment.\r\nThe call connect times were inconsistent across the plant, not just that area.\r\n \r\nI would suggest having KLA come back out, possibly with Verizon to investigate the repeater, passive network and the cell site.\r\nWhen we reduced attenuation below what we should have, after we CW verified signal gain and path flow, that concerns me that the cell site is having some uplink issue. Either not enough signal from the repeater, too much noise from repeater, too much noise from traffic at the cell site, PN pollution, cell site blocking, or something physical with the site itself.  It will be one of two things: Poor SNR on the uplink, or something with the donor site itself(which either one can be multiple things).\r\nFirst thing would be to have request Verizon look at the PC health stats screen on the Nortel equipment(if it is still Nortel there) and see what the RX0n and RX1n values are. I can do the calcs for the noise floor from those readings. It will be a 3 digit number format(IE 156, 164, etc).\r\nI can tell if the noise floor is high, low or normal from those readings.\r\n \r\nThere are potentially 2 cell sites where the donor antenna is pointing. One south of the GH bridge between Jackson and Washington east of US31, the other is on M104 by the new ACE hardware(it is by that park where the bike path comes in, across from the Shell gas station) by Fruitport road intersection in Spring Lake.
